When violence in Israel and Gaza escalated after last month's terror attack by Hamas, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued a statement warning against "discriminatory behavior" against Israeli athletes competing around the world.
"[A]thletes cannot be held responsible for the actions of their governments," an IOC spokesperson told the German Press Agency, promising "swift action" if incidents occur.
Russian officials reacted angrily to the IOC's stance toward Israel, noting that in October the Russian Olympic Committee was suspended for actions taken in occupied regions of eastern Ukraine.
"This is, of course, outrageous," said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in an interview posted on Telegram. "Once again we see an example of the bias and ineptitude of the International Olympic Committee, which time and again proves its political bent."
